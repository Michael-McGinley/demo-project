//BDD Core Practces
//Discovery - Clarify user needs, system rules and identifying the scope of work - user story
//Formulation - Translating requirements into executable specifications using Gherkin - Java to execute step definitions
//Automation - Implemennting behaviour through automated tests - use the framework to execute the tests

//Advantages to Cucumber-JVM

//Gherkin syntax
//Feature represents a high-level description of the feature and provides context for the scenarios
//Scenario describes the specific behaviour or test case
//Given - Specifies the initial preconditions for the scenario
//When - Indicates the specific action that triggers the behaviour under test
//Then - Defines the expected outcome of the scenario
//And - combines multiple steps of the same type
//But - combines multiple steps of the same type with an alternative outcome

//Tags are labels or identifiers used to categorise scenarios, enabling selective test execution and organisation
